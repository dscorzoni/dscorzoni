Welcome to my github! My name is Danilo Scorzoni RÃ©, I'm a Data Scientist at Instagram/Facebook Inc. I work in the Partnerships Science team, 
supporting our Commerce and Media Partnerships teams to make sure that commerce products are delivering value to IG Partners. I mostly use **SQL**, **R**, 
**Python/pandas** and **statistical methods** to extract insights to inform product teams strategy and backup marketing materials to Partners.

<details><summary>The main statistical methods that I use in my daily work are (click to open):</summary>

<br />

* Descriptive statistics.
* Hypothesis testing (t-test, confidence intervals, etc).
* Causal analysis with regression models.
* Linear models, generalized linear models (includes logistic regression and others).
* Survival analysis applied to churn.
* Multivariate methods such as Principal Component Analysis, k-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.

<details><summary>From my past experiences, I have worked with statistical modelling, using both classic statistical methods or machine learning algorithms:</summary>

<br />

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* K-means
* Hierarchical clustering
* Kohonen Maps for Unsupervised Learning

</details>

I also have some background on Data Engineering, using task scheduler frameworks as **Airflow**, and building star-schema design and dimensional tables based on app logging data. Another think that I love to do is building dashboards. I have experience with FB's proprietary tools but also like to work with **Tableau**.
