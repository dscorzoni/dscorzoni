Welcome to my github! My name is Danilo Scorzoni RÃ©, I'm a Data Scientist with more than 10 years of experience. I mostly use **SQL**, **R**, 
**Python/pandas** and **statistical methods** to extract insights to inform product teams strategy and backup marketing materials.

<details><summary>The main statistical methods that I use in my daily work are (click to open):</summary>

<br />

* Descriptive statistics.
* Hypothesis testing (t-test, confidence intervals, etc).
* Causal analysis with regression models and propensity score matching.
* Linear models, generalized linear models (includes logistic regression and others).
* Survival analysis applied to churn.
* Multivariate methods such as Principal Component Analysis, k-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.
</details>

<details><summary>From my past experiences, I have worked with statistical modelling, using both classic statistical methods or machine learning algorithms:</summary>

<br />

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* K-means
* Hierarchical clustering
* Kohonen Maps for Unsupervised Learning

</details>

I also have some background on Data Engineering, using data workflow frameworks as **Airflow**, and building star-schema design and dimensional data modeling based on app events logging data. Another thing that I love to do is building dashboards. I have experience with FB's proprietary tools but also like to work with **Tableau**.

Given the lack of good content about R in Portuguese, I decided to create an YouTube channel to teach R in that language. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOQvCZKYcL1xFqcQ5z7Wmww/)!
